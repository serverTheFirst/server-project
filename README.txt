# README

The aim of this repo is to develop, over time, a beginner walkthrough of the entire process of setting up a server that self hosts some/most/all of the popular self hosted apps. 

The difference between this and other content providers is usually the guides others make are in a silo and there are a million things that can go wrong when following a guide if your setup has a conflict.

It is very hard for beginners to troubleshoot conflicts. I have found, much to the dismay of the more experienced users I know, that is is much easier to blast the problem program and start fresh. This process is destructive by nature, but beginners need to learn the routine of installing apps, and installing the same one over and over helps you rally understand what the files are looking for.

This server project is built on unRAID. Some people coming here may not like that, or may tell me to use something else for this project, but  they can make their own guide. I like unRAID for beginners because it allows you to get an old computer and fill it with hard drives and get going. The initial unRAID setup can be cumbersome, but there are tons of resources to help you through that.

The long range goals of this project will ultimately become several guides to make several different servers that all serve different purposes.

# vivaldi


Vivaldi is my browser of choice. I wanted to stay away from chrome and safari because i was looking for something that is less tied to large corporations. I looked at a lot of the browsers (fof some reason I didn't look at brave).

I like vivaldi because I can put tabs on the left and bookmarks on the bottom and the view is much cleaner for me.
